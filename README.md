# aita-predictor
## Goal
The goal of this project is to be able to predict the outcome of an [r/aita](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/) post as one of three choices with accuracy:
- NTA (Not the Asshole)
- AH (You're the Asshole)
- NAH (No Assholes Here)
- ESH (Everyone Sucks Here)
## Components
### Web Scraper
- The Web Scraper will gather recent posts given a number and store them in a database **Not sure what format yet**
### Training
- Once the desired posts are compiled a **________** machine learning algorithm will be trained
### Prediction / Test
- We should be able to predict a post at this point, given some tweaks to the algorithm
### UI
- Not sure if I want to make a UI to submit posts yet, but it could be useful and a good project to do with django
